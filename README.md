# ui-overwatch
`ui-overwatch` is a tool, which should help to keep the functionality
of your UI/Application across instances working. This comes in handy,
if you have the same application running on several instances.

With overwatch, you configure a project, and define test scenarios.
Those test scenarios will run against every project configured and alarm you
if some tests fail.

Those test scenarios are executed using [playwright](https://playwright.dev/).
